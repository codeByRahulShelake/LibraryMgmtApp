Java Library Management System
Overview
The Java Library Management System is a console-based application designed to efficiently manage a library's operations. The system provides functionality for managing books, members, and administrative tasks, with features for searching, borrowing, and returning books. The application supports role-based functionality, with distinct capabilities for administrators and members.

The project uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for data storage, connecting to a MySQL database to manage library records persistently.

Manage personal account details.
Project Structure
1. LibraryApp.java
The main application class that acts as the entry point for the program, handling user interactions and facilitating communication between different components.

Methods:
void main(String[] args): Entry point for the application.
void displayBooks(): Displays all available books.
void addBook(String title, String author): Adds a new book to the library.
Book searchBook(String title): Searches for a book by its title.
boolean borrowBook(String title): Facilitates book borrowing by users.
boolean returnBook(String title): Allows users to return a previously borrowed book.
2. Admin.java
Handles administrative operations for managing books and library members.

Methods:
void addBook(String title, String author): Adds a new book.
boolean removeBook(String title): Removes a book from the library.
void viewAllBooks(): Lists all books.
boolean updateBookDetails(String oldTitle, String newTitle, String newAuthor): Updates book details.
Additional methods for managing member accounts, viewing loan histories, and updating book/member details.
3. Member.java
Handles member-specific operations for interacting with library books and personal account management.

Methods:
Book searchBook(String title): Allows a member to search for a book by title.
boolean borrowBook(String title): Facilitates borrowing of books.
boolean returnBook(String title): Handles book returns.
void viewBorrowedBooks(): Displays a list of borrowed books for the member.
Additional methods for managing personal information and interactions with library services.
How It Works
Account Management:
Admins can add, update, or delete books and manage member accounts.
Members can search for books, borrow, and return them.
Book Management:
Books are stored and managed within the application using MySQL as a persistent data storage solution.
Transaction Management:
Transactions, such as borrowing and returning books, are logged and managed to track availability and user history.
JDBC and MySQL Integration:
The application uses JDBC to connect and interact with a MySQL database.
Data, such as book and member details, are persistently stored and retrieved using SQL queries executed via JDBC.
Prerequisites
JDK: Java Development Kit (Version 8 or later).
MySQL: MySQL server for database operations.
JDBC: Properly configured JDBC driver for MySQL.
An IDE or text editor supporting Java development.
